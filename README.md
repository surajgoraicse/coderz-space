# About Coderz Space

Coderz Space is a platform that provides **free subdomains** for developers and students.  
It helps users learn how DNS works, how to configure records, and how to host projects without paying for a domain.

The platform is designed as both a utility and a learning space where beginners can understand real-world DNS behavior by using it directly.

## Why Coderz Space Exists
- Domains cost money and are not accessible for many students.
- DNS concepts are difficult to understand without real use.
- Developers need a quick way to put projects online.

Coderz Space solves this by offering free subdomains with a simple workflow.

## What You Can Learn
- DNS fundamentals  
- Subdomain configuration  
- Record types (A, CNAME, TXT, etc.)  
- How hosting and routing actually work  

We are expanding Coderz Space into a complete toolkit for student developers — making it easier to launch full-stack projects without credits or paid infrastructure.

## Upcoming Features

### Free Temporary Emails
- Useful for testing authentication flows  
- Supports OTP, newsletters, and dev environments  

### Static Website Deployment
- Deploy portfolios, documentation sites, and frontend projects with one click  

### Object Storage (Cloudinary-like)
- Simple storage for images, files, and assets  
- Ideal for SaaS prototypes, college projects, and hackathons  


Coderz Space aims to become a simple toolkit that helps developers test, deploy, and understand how the web works.
